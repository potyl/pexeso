PEXESO
======

This program consists of the pexeso game. A fun game that we all have played as
kids and that never gets old. It's a nice educational game that helps train the
memory capacities.

The game is written entirely in Perl using the Clutter API. What's interesting
about this version is that it has a very nice Perl twist. I will let you
discover which one by playing the game for your self.

The purpose of this program is two server two educational purposes at once.
First of all it's meant to serve as a show case on how to build a nice
interactive application with Clutter without hanging the event loop. Secondly
it provides a new educational game for all of us to enjoy.
